        <p>4.1 - Now that we have created our target bucket (where to store reports) and our SNS service, we need to add that to the code in our repository, so that our buildspec.yml includes that information -- so that CodeBuild job can find the right bucket and SNS service.</p>
        <p>To do that, navigate to the scripts/writeBuildspec.js and fill in the bucket name for the <code>const testResultsBucket</code> (you can find this value back at section 3.2 screenshot).</p> 
        <p> Next, copy the ARN of the SNS topic we created for <code>const snsTopic</code> (you can find this value back at section 3.8 screenshot) .</p>

        <p> An easy way to begin creating an IAM policy for the CodeBuild job is to first navigate over to <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?">AWS CodeBuild</a> </p>
        <p>Then go ahead and click on the name of the CodeBuild job you created at section 2.9.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, all of that worked. Of course, if it did not, something odd could have happened somewhere. While developing this walkthrough, I had a few issues with buildLogs and artifiacts not going where they need to go. There might be some trial and error involved.</p>
        <p>Assuming everything worked for you -- you can now push your code to GitHub, trigger your CodeBuild, run Cypress E2E tests in the CodeBuild environment, merge tests into a single HTML report, export tests to a pre-determined directory in a test results S3 bucket, and send an e-mail to topic subscribers which includes a hyperlink to the test results!</p>
        <p>In the next section, we will use CloudFront CDN service to deploy the built web application and include an SSL certificate so that we can use HTTPS protocol.</p>
