        <p>This template and walkthrough can help you launch a basic web application and run cypess E2E tests in the AWS CodeBuild environment.</p>
        <p>Additionally, this repository uses some custom scripting (scripts/writeBuildspec.js) which programmatically generates a new buildspec.yml file in the root directory everytime a user runs the command <code>$ npm run git "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"</code>, where you put your commit message in quotes.</p>
        <p>Following along with this walkthrough will show a user how to set up a simple AWS CodePipeline, triggered by pushing new code to the master branch of the repository.</p>

        <p>In order to properly use this template, a user just needs to slightly alter their workflow...</p>
        <ol>
          <li>1. First, do whatever work you need to do in changing your code, save all files.</li>
          <li>2. Next, type <code>$ npm run git "COMMIT MESSAGE"</code> This will update your buildspec.yml to include your latest commit message and include a timestamp -- that information will be included in your S3 test report storage, and simple e-mail notifaction, so you can easily find the test results later.</li>
          <li>3. When a user has made enough changes, use the common <code>$ npm push origin</code> command to push to GitHub -- the GitHub Webhooks set up during this tutotial will trigger the AWS CodeBuild process, build the project, run the cypress tests, etc.</li>

        <p>One note - sometimes the left-hand navigation drawer of this walkthrough disappears if you open up the console or make the view-width too narrow. That's a bug I'm working on ðŸ˜….</p>
