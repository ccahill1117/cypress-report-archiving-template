# cypress-reporting Vue.JS template

## About this project

> I developed this project over the course of an internship with M Science LLC, from Mar-2019 to Jun-2019. My mentor, Joe Taylor (Lead UI/UX Architect), and I were interested in creating an archive of e2e test reports, based around the Cypress testing framework.
